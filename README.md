# 🌐 First HTML & CSS Website

This is my very first functional one-page website, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. I created this project while learning web development through **EMC Academy**. It showcases the basic structure and styling of a static webpage — a solid starting point for my journey into frontend development.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – The main HTML file containing the page structure  
- `style.css` – The CSS file for styling the webpage

## 🚀 How to View

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser  
3. Explore the layout and design

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Writing semantic HTML tags  
- Linking external CSS stylesheets  
- Styling text, layout, and colors  
- Organizing code for readability

## 📚 Credits

Created as part of my learning experience at **EMC Academy**.
